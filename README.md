# dscov-github-workshop
Demonstration repository for the workshop **Collaborative Coding for Science using Git, GitHub and Pull Requests**

> ## 🎯 Aim for the Workshop
> 
> We're going to collectively format a copy of the [Wikipedia page about Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) using "[Markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/)," one of the text formats which GitHub uses for README files, comments on code, etc. 

## Approach 

- [**⇨ Start Here 🔗**](how-to-start.md) We'll start from an incorrectly formatted version of the [Wikipedia page about Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git). The original is here: https://github.com/brown-ccv/dscov-github-workshop/blob/main/git-text-content.md. 
- [**Issue 🔗**](how-to-issue.md): You'll choose an issue. 
- [**Branch 🔗**](how-to-branch.md):  You'll make a "branch" which can be shared, where they can make changes. 
- [**Commit 🔗**](how-to-commit.md):  You'll make a series of "commits" where they actually fix the issue, bit-by-bit.
- [**Push  🔗**](how-to-push.md): You'll "push" your branch to GitHub.
- **Pull Request**
  - [**Create 🔗**](how-to-pr.md): You'll make a "pull request" (PR) which says "please incorporate the changes in *my* branch in *your* branch. 
  - [**Review 🔗**](how-to-pr-review.md): Reviewers (your peers) will have the chance to look at the PR and suggest changes and improvements, or to say "this is great, let's merge it!"
  - [**Merge 🔗**](how-to-pr-merge.md): The author of the PR will merge the approved PR.
  - [**Update 🔗**](how-to-pr-update.md): Everyone will update their now-outdated-PRs to incorporate the new merged changes, before they too are merged. 
  - [**Merge Conflicts 🔗**](how-to-merge-conflict.md): If people work on the same part of the document, then the authors will resolve the conflicting changes.
